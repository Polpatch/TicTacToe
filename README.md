## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>


I want to increase my knowledge of Unity3d, so I decided to start this adventure starting from something simple, Tic Tac Toe.
But, not to be TOO trivial, I want to make sure to allow the player to play not only with a second user, but also with an AI that I intend to train autonomously through an adversarial approach.
 At the moment I'm still in the design phase, I will update the readme file as I progress.
